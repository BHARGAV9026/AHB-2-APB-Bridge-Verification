🔍 Key Highlights: 
   - Designed comprehensive testbench architecture using SystemVerilog.  
   - Implemented UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) to achieve reusable and scalable verification environments.  
   - Developed and executed test cases for corner scenarios, performance, and protocol compliance.  
   - Automated verification metrics tracking using coverage-driven methodologies.  
   - Ensured protocol compliance for both AMBA AHB and APB standards.  

🏆 Outcome: 
     Achieved 100% functional,Assertion and code coverage, ensuring a robust and reliable bridge for real-world applications.  

💡 What I learned:
     This project strengthened my skills in UVM, debugging, and understanding the intricacies of SoC bus protocols. It also honed my ability to create reusable and efficient verification environments.  

Description:
    The AHB to APB Bridge is an AHB slave which works as an interface between the high speed AHB and the low performance APB buses. The class-based verification environment is architected using UVM, and a verification plan is defined. The RTL module is verified with UVM TB with different test scenarios like single & burst transfers. Functional coverage is generated for the RTL verification sign-off.The AHB to APB Bridge is an interface bus system that builds data flow synchronization between high-speed AHB and low-peripheral APB IPs. It is based on AMBA Protocols.

Responsibilities:
   => Architected the Class based Verification environment in UVM.
   => Defined Verification Plan.
   => Verified the RTL model with UVM Test bench with different test case scenarios.
   => Generated functional and Code Coverage for the RTL verification sign-off.
